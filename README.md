## Description
MatchMyNeeds is a hub for communities all over the world to donate and share their items with one another. The website is completely free, an individual that signs up for an account can post their needs/request for a specific item and connects people from all over the nation to fulfill their ask. Purely giving out of the goodness of one’s heart or simply to declutter their space. There’s no limit to how much you can give or how much you can ask. The beauty about our application is that we connect people through community and the experience of sharing that item. What sets us apart from a thrift store is that users do not blindly give, they are personally donating their item to an individual who will give it a second chance.

## User Story
In the perspective of a <font color="red"> requester: </font> <br />
As a individual with a need, <br />
I want a safe platform where I can request for an item that can be shared with users across the globe, <br />
so that I can save money and time in hopes that my ask will be fulfilled.

In the perspective of a <font color="red"> gifter: </font>  <br />
As a individual who likes to help people, <br />
I want to donate my belongings with  others in need, <br />
so I can recycle an item I no longer have a purpose for.

## Usage
From the homepage, navigate to the login page by clicking on the top right hand side of the page to first make an account. You will not be able to view or create a request without first signing in. To create an account, the user must make a username, enter their personal email address, and create a unique password. All three entries are required to create an account. Once completed, you can navigate to "My Requests" page or "All Requests" page using the navigation bar. To create a request, the My Request page will contain a request form that will prompt the user to add the name of the item, a short description, as well as the location of the requester. Once they hit submit, they will be able to view their request long with other user requests in the All Requests page. As they scroll through a request and see an item they are interested in fulfilling, the user can simply click on a request that will then navigate to a separate webpage with the detailed information of the request that includes the general location of where the requester is located. If a user has a specific question, they can comment on the post directly to obtain more information on the item. If they are interested in fulfilling the need, they can also reserve the item with a comment on the specified post.
