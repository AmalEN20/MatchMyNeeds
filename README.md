## Description
MatchMyNeeds is a hub for communities all over the world to donate and share their items with one another. The website is completely free, an individual that signs up for an account can post their needs/request for a specific item and connects people from all over the nation to fulfill their ask. Purely giving out of the goodness of one’s heart or simply to declutter their space. There’s no limit to how much you can give or how much you can ask. The beauty about our application is that we connect people through community and the experience of sharing that item. What sets us apart from a thrift store is that users do not blindly give, they are personally donating their item to an individual who will give it a second chance.



## Usage
From the homepage, you can must first make an account to make request or view requests.
